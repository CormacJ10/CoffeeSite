	Here is where the drinks get to become advanced coffee drinks that makes places such as Starbucks such a financial success, though it is not because of the drinks alone did Starbucks become 	successful, it was the fact that people need to have a drink up and ready once they wake up in order for them to be alert and mentally aware of the surroundings each and every day which is why coffee places are such a success it is because people have become addicted to the most common drug of the world, caffeine.

    <p><!-- Recipe on how to make coffee drink -->
	Ingredients needed: 7g ground coffee, 1/2 cup (125 ml) chilled milk, 1 to 2 Tbsp of sugar, 1 to 2 Tbsp of flavored syrup (any flavor), 1 to 2 cups of ice.
    </p>
	<p>
	Garnishes: Whipped cream, Flavored syrup, Flavored confection chips (milk chocolate, semi-sweet chocolate, white chocolate, butterscotch, etc.), Sprinkles
	</p>
    <p>
	Prepare the cup necessary for the coffee as well as placing brown sugar onto the cup, if wanting to do so, before the coffee or steamed milk for it to be melted once the hot coffee is poured onto the cup.
    </p>
    <p>
	Foam the milk by placing the milk in a jug and then steam it on the steaming wand on the espresso machine, but in a cheap way you could warm the milk on the stove by placing it on a small pot and stir it by swaying the pot or jug either clockwise or counter-clockwise or use an automatic stirrer to do so until it turns velvety white.
    </p>
    <p>
	Grind the coffee beans. A homemade frappuccino will taste best if you start with fresh coffee beans, even though this is not strictly a necessity.
	For a standard 6-oz (180-ml) cup of coffee, you will need to use roughly 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of coffee beans. This translates into 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of coffee beans per 3 oz (90 ml), or 1 tsp (5 ml) of coffee beans per 1 oz (30 ml) of water.
	You will need 4 oz (125 ml) of freshly brewed coffee for both recipes, but the coffee needs to be at double strength. For a normal 4-oz serving of coffee, you would need 4 tsp (20 ml) of coffee beans. For this recipe, you will need 8 tsp (40 ml) of coffee beans.
	Grind the beans down using a manual or electric coffee grinder. Do this immediately before you intend to prepare your frappuccino since the coffee grounds will lose flavor as they sit out.
     </p>
     <p>
	Brew the coffee. Add 1/2 cup (125 ml) water and your freshly ground coffee to your coffee maker. Allow the machine to cycle through the brewing process.
	You can use commercially processed and packaged coffee grounds, if desired, instead of freshly ground.
	Use a coffee maker that can prepare individual portions, if you have one. If not, you may need to make more coffee than necessary for this recipe. Make sure to grind more beans or measure more coffee grounds according to the information explained in the grinding step.
    </p>
    <p>
	Combine the coffee, sugar, milk, and syrup. Add the cooled coffee, granulated sugar, whole milk, and flavored syrup to a blender and mix, on high speed, for 20 seconds to combine well.
	If you have an espresso machine, you could also skip the coffee altogether and brew a shot of espresso, instead.
	The amount of sugar and flavored syrup you need depends on how sweet you want the drink or how strong you want the flavor to be. You should use at least 1 Tbsp (15 ml) each of sugar and flavored syrup, but if you have a stronger sweet tooth or want a stronger flavor, use up to 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of each.
	Common flavored syrups include mocha, chocolate, vanilla, and caramel.
	Whole milk really does work best for this recipe due to the taste and texture, but low-fat or no-fat milk can be used instead if you prefer a healthier version.
    </p>
    <p>
	Add the ice. Add 1 cup (250 ml) of ice to the blender and blend, on high, for another 20 seconds.
	The finished texture of the drink should be fairly slushy.
	If possible, use crushed ice. 
	Some refrigerators can produce crushed ice, but if yours does not have that feature, you can place ice cubes into a thick resealable plastic bag and crush them with a rolling pin. Crushed ice is much easier for your blender to chop.
	Add more ice if necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
	Top generously with whipped cream. 
	At the very least, you should consider decorating your finished frappuccino with a heavy dollop or swirl of whipped cream.
	You can use whipped cream as your only garnish, or you could use it as a "base" for your other garnishes.
    </p>
	<p>
	Drizzle with flavored syrup. 
	Drizzle flavored syrup back and forth across the whipped cream, creating a zig-zag pattern on top.
	Use the same flavor for your garnish as the flavor used in your frappuccino. 
	If you do not use the same flavor, at least use one that compliments the original flavor instead of clashing with it.
	</p>
	<p>
	Garnish with flavored confection chips or sugar sprinkles. 
	If you want to create a more colorful, fun decoration, you could use confection chips or colored crystal sugar sprinkles.
	Use flavored chips that compliment the flavor of your frappuccino.
	As a general rule, stay away from the combination of confection chips and sprinkles, as this may be overkill.
	</p>
	<p>
	Serve immediately. 
	This drink is best served as soon as it is prepared. 
	If it sits out too long, it will becomes soupy. 
	Pour the drink into your glass, garnish as desired, and enjoy.

    <p><!-- Recipe on how to make coffee drink -->
	Ingredients needed: 7g ground coffee, Chilled Milk.
    </p>
    <p>
	Prepare the cup necessary for the coffee as well as placing brown sugar onto the cup, if wanting to do so, before the coffee or steamed milk for it to be melted once the hot coffee is poured onto the cup.
    </p>
    <p>
	Steam your milk. 
	Steaming your milk for a Macchiato is pretty much the same as you would do for a cappuccino. 
	Use a 12oz. pitcher when doing this. Fill it up to the base of the nozzle with milk. 
	You won't be using all the milk, but you want enough in the pitcher so you have more time to steam. 
	The more milk, the longer it will take to get it up to 155 degrees, giving more time to play around with the foam. 
	Remember Caff√® Macchiato means "marked with foam", so you want to make a lot of foam, but it is just a mark you do not need to use a lot for each individual cup.
	Put the tip of the nozzle at the surface of the milk. 
	Get a good swirling action going and surf the hole. 
	This will cause the milk and the foam to mix together. 
	Your milk and foam should not separate until it is poured into the cup.
	Keep on surfing the hole until the amount in the pitcher has doubled. 
	Please , don't exceed 160 degrees, and avoid bubbles in your foam. 
	Tap the pitcher to get out all the bubbles, spin it, all that jazz.
    </p>
    <p>
	Pull a double espresso shot. 
	If you're a skilled barista, with a good machine, you should have your shot and your milk going at the same time. 
	If your machine won't permit you to do this, then keep the pitcher swirling. 
	If you're not sure on how to pull a good shot, grind fresh, tamp thrice. 
	Easy enough? A good shot should be about 21-25 seconds, some say 23-27; it depends on the machine and the beans. 
	Just make sure it's all good.
    </p>
    <p> 
	Give your pitcher another swirl. 
	If you didn't get enough foam while steaming then pour out a little bit of the milk. 
	To do this, take a spoon and place it in front on the pitcher while pouring it into the sink so you hold the foam from pouring out. 
	Give it another little spin. Take your espresso and hold the cup at a slight angle.
    </p>
    <p>
	Pour the frothy milk from the pitcher into the espresso, right into the center. 
	Raise the elevation of the pitcher as you pour to keep the speed steady. 
	Only pour a little bit of the frothed milk into the espresso. 
	If you have more milk than espresso then you're dabbling in the area of cappuccino.

    </p>
    <p>
	Then place the ground coffee on the single, or double-shot if long black, espresso shot group heads on the espresso machine, but the cheaper method is by placing it on a group head on a low-tech espresso machine(or flask) and then crush it into place by using a spoon in order for the coffee to not get runny or soggy after being extracted of its juices. 
    </p>
    <p>
	Place the flask on the stove and wait for approximately 7 minutes, or wait until the flask starts steaming and whistling, and then pour the extracted coffee onto a cup that is 100 ml, for single shot(demitasse), or 150ml(tulip), for double-shot, only until it reaches its end but do not let it overfill the cup so aas to leave room for sugar to be added.
    </p>
	<p>
	Pour the entire jug filled with the steamed milk until it fills the entire cup along without the foam and finish it with a thin layer of foam so that it looks elegant and a bit less thicker than the cappuccino.
