  <p><!-- First paragraph(s) is the history of coffee -->
    THE HISTORY OF COFFEE -> In the Ethiopian highlands, where the legend of Kaldi, the goatherd, originated, coffee trees grow today as they have for centuries. Though we will never know with certainty, there probably is some truth to the Kaldi legend.
</p>
<p>
It is said that he discovered coffee after noticing that his goats, upon eating berries from a certain tree, became so spirited that they did not want to sleep at night.
</p>
<p>
Kaldi dutifully reported his findings to the abbot of the local monastery who made a drink with the berries and discovered that it kept him alert for the long hours of evening prayer.  Soon the abbot had shared his discovery with the other monks at the monastery, and ever so slowly knowledge of the energizing effects of the berries began to spread.  As word moved east and coffee reached the Arabian peninsula, it began a journey which would spread its reputation across the globe.
</p>
<p>
Today coffee is grown in a multitude of countries around the world. Whether it is Asia or Africa, Central or South America, the islands of the Caribbean or Pacific, all can trace their heritage to the trees in the ancient coffee forests on the Ethiopian plateau.
</p>
<p>
European travellers to the Near East brought back stories of the unusual dark black beverage. By the 17th century, coffee had made its way to Europe and was becoming popular across the continent. Opponents were overly cautious, calling the beverage the 'bitter invention of Satan.' With the coming of coffee to Venice in 1615, the local clergy condemned it. The controversy was so great that Pope Clement VIII was asked to intervene. Before making a decision however, he decided to taste the beverage for himself. He found the drink so satisfying that he gave it Papal approval.
</p>
<p>
Despite such controversy, in the major cities of England, Austria, France, Germany and Holland, coffee houses were quickly becoming centers of social activity and communication. In England 'penny universities' sprang up, so called because for the price of a penny one could purchase a cup of coffee and engage in stimulating conversation.  By the mid-17th century, there were over 300 coffee houses in London, many of which attracted patrons with common interests, such as merchants, shippers, brokers and artists.

Many businesses grew out of these specialized coffee houses. Lloyd's of London, for example, came into existence at the Edward Lloyd's Coffee House. See the history of coffee page for further information.

  <p><!-- Second Paragraph(s) concern the ability of baristaas today -->
    Coffee at the beginning was just considered as a drink, however nowadays with people already used to the fantastic flavour and effect of the so called "drink" and transformed it into an artform. An example of this is one of my co-workers making a cappuccino and adding enough froth bubbles on top of the drink to enable him to transform the top of the drink into a 3-dimensional artform of Snoopy the Dog from the adventures of Charlie Brown. 
    </p>
    <p>This is just a sample of what baristas today and coffee enthusiasts are able accomplish through the advancement of time as well as the advancement of human civilisation which deems most materials and byproducts of society into a romanticised art form that enables us baristas, no us artists to convey our emotion and opinion to the world. To know how to do some of the basics of this, as well as making basic coffee drinks, please refer to the how to make basic coffee drinks web page of this site to know more.
